            <p>
              In 2017, three friends came together with a dream. They wanted to
              kickstart their careers as entrepreneurs in the Information
              Technology industry. This dream faced many obstacles, including
              but not limited to the global pandemic. The trio had to tackle
              many challenges both in their personal and professional lives.
              Yet, their spirits were not dulled. Their experiences and failures
              had made them tougher. One day, the three decided that they
              wouldnâ€™t wait around any longer. Hence, Zevo was born. Not from
              scratch, but as a resurrection from their past failures. It was
              their phoenix that arose from the ashes. As time passed, the Zevo
              family grew. Before they knew it, they clocked a seven-figure
              revenue in three months. The story of Zevo is a story of dreams. A
              story of the light at the end of the tunnel. The story of us all.
